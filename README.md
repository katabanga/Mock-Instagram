# Mock-Instagram
Created a mock instagram platform using Python, SQL, Javascript, React, and Flask, with many of the same features, including the ability to create/delete accounts, post photos, like/unlike/comment posts, follow/unfollow people from the explore page, and change portfolio photos or login passwords which are stored using SHA512.
